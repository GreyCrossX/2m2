markers =
    unit: fast, isolated tests of single functions/classes
    integration: combine multiple components within/between services (no external net unless mocked)
    e2e: full pipeline tests (calc -> redis -> poller -> celery handlers)
    mainnet: hits live external APIs (Binance); run manually in protected env
    exchange: exchange facade & SDK contract tests
    slow: takes longer than typical unit tests
    asyncio: test uses asyncio event loop
